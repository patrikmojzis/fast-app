**MODULARITY is the key**
_goal: make this package work like Laravel_

our principle: "Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."

| path | purpose | description |
| fast_app/core | for user | always-on fundamentals |
| fast_app/integrations | extra | optional stuff that is commonly used |
| fast_app/utils | package utils | stuff that will NOT be imported by users |
| fast_app/contracts | building block | contains abstracts and bases |
| fast_app/exceptions | importable exceptions | yeah exceptions | 
| fast_app/cli | fast-app command | helper commands user can use in CLI |
| fast_app/templates/make | fast-app make <name> | make model, observer, policy... |
| fast_app/templates/publish | fast-app publish <name> | optional code you use almost in every project it packed here |
| fast_app/templates/project_structure | fast-app init | base project |


limitations: fast-app framework is focus on API and backend apps. we do not render any FE. 
vission: we want to take common elements that you always copy when initing a new project and have them all in one package.
